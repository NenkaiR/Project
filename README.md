This will cointain my project developments and all the hard work I put to it
The project title is Task Manager
Once the program is launched, a list of tasks appears 
If you want to add task you will be required to input a number, then a follow up on the exact task to be done.

The same is listed as the task name
You will get a return message that the task has been added successfully.
To list task you will enter number 3 and the same will return with the status of the task whether complete or not.
To remove task you enter option 4
and to quit from the program enter option 5 and that lets you out of the program with a Good bye message.
