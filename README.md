This will cointain my project developments and all the hard work I put to it
The project title is Task Manager.
It cointains Adding of tasks,Listing,Marking tasks as Complete or incomplete and removing the same.
 To add task - used append to successfully add the tasks needed and also used trhe condition false to show that they are not complete.
Int and input is to show that a number will be required to enter
List basically displays the tasks that have been input
Pop is used to remove the what had been added to the list while invalid is for the response that is not defined.
